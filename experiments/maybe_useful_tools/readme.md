# Introduction
- This is simple set of tools i have used. They are not much, but if you might need them, use them, edit them etc.

## Before use:

- **must** use in order or it wont work!
- **must** be on using **Windows**!
- **must** have **yt-dlp** (recommended for faster download speed) or **yt/dl** and **ffmpeg**!
- **both ffmpeg and yt-dlp must be in same folder as these script othervise it wont work!**
- You can download this scripts and use and edit on your own

## Usage:

 1. Download your files using `download_all_videos_batch.bat`
 2. After downloading run `generate_cut_videos_batch.bat`. This will generate `cut_videos_batch2.bat` file.
 3. You should be able to run this generated `cut_videos_batch2.bat` file which will cut all videos to 1 min. from the begining.
 4. Run `generate_normalize_vid_batch_file.bat`which will generate `normalize_videos_batch2.bat`.
 5. You should be able to run this generated `normalize_videos_batch2.bat` file which will convert all videos to 30 fps.
 6. (Optional) Run `generate_file_paths.bat` which will generate video paths which then you can insert into `input.txt` file of my program to create luminance for your videos
